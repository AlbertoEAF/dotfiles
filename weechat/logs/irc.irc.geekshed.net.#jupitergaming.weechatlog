2014-01-06 15:17:42	Public	<[Public] -silvrax> your tower appear way more classy tho
2014-01-06 15:18:33	Public	<[Public] -rakudave> well I did spend hours and hours in the nether getting that quartz :-)
2014-01-06 15:18:45	Public	<[Public] -rakudave> but I'm just teasing
2014-01-06 15:18:58	Public	<[Public] -silvrax> i know, no worries
2014-01-06 15:19:10	Public	<[Public] -rakudave> your balcony for example does look very nice :-)
2014-01-06 15:19:30	Public	<[Public] -silvrax> it turned out pretty good yeah
2014-01-06 15:19:48	Public	<[Public] -silvrax> since this is litterally my first tower anyway
2014-01-06 15:20:52	Public	<[Public] -silvrax> i think i should get rid of the glass thingy i initially put up tho
2014-01-06 15:22:01	Public	<[Public] -rakudave> yeah I agree, it detracts from the much better looking tower next to it
2014-01-06 15:22:13	Public	<[Public] -silvrax> yeah...
2014-01-06 15:22:32	Public	<[Public] -silvrax> are you still making improvements on the inside of yours?
2014-01-06 15:22:47	Public	<[Public] -rakudave> but good job for a first tower - should have seen my first attempts to build circular towers :-D
2014-01-06 15:23:05	Public	<[Public] -rakudave> nah probably not, just some polishing maybe
2014-01-06 15:23:22	Public	<[Public] -rakudave> but my vacation is over so I don't have so much time for ist anyway :-/
2014-01-06 15:23:42	Public	<[Public] -silvrax> same here :(
2014-01-06 15:24:56	Public	<[Public] -silvrax> it's pretty annoying how clouds float inside of a tower i think...

2014-01-06 15:33:22	Public	<[Creative] -BluPhenix316> think i might just tear down this villager, and try and come up with something else
2014-01-06 15:33:25	Hermit	Well I hope you don't quit. I've enjoyed playing with you.
2014-01-06 15:33:37	Public	<[Creative] -BluPhenix316> oh no man i'm not gonna quit playing
2014-01-06 15:33:50	Public	<[Creative] -BluPhenix316> i'm just gonna give up on the village idea
2014-01-06 15:34:01	Hermit	There must have wither been some spawnable space that you overlooked or they got over your fence somehow.
2014-01-06 15:34:08	Hermit	either*
2014-01-06 15:34:49	Public	<[Creative] -BluPhenix316> i saw a zombie spawn right next to a torch though

2014-01-06 15:35:08	Hermit	O.o that's certainly odd
2014-01-06 15:35:10	Public	<[Creative] -BluPhenix316> but anyway, this village is dead
2014-01-06 15:35:20	Public	<[Public] -rakudave> sure that's not just lag?
2014-01-06 15:35:47	Public	<[Creative] -BluPhenix316> rakudave: well i went out of my house, and all my villagers are gone, and there is zombie flesh
2014-01-06 15:35:52	Public	<[Creative] -BluPhenix316> so if that is just lag
2014-01-06 15:35:57	Hermit	Well for now you can still live there, even though you don't have villagers. Then you can add them back if you decide to one day
2014-01-06 15:36:14	Public	<[Creative] -BluPhenix316> i'm just gonna ranksack the down and build a palace or something
2014-01-06 15:36:33	Public	<[Public] -rakudave> hm yeah that's a bit weird
2014-01-06 15:38:50	Public	<[Creative] -BluPhenix316> well i think i figured out how they were doing it

2014-01-06 15:38:56	Public	<[Creative] -BluPhenix316> they jumped down off the side of a hill

2014-01-06 15:39:07	Public	<[Creative] -BluPhenix316> landed on the fence and walked the fence into the village
2014-01-06 15:39:24	Public	<[Public] -rakudave> yeah that'd make sense
