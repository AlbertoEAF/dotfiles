2014-01-01 01:21:23	kitsunekitty	it isn't going to beat out Arch or Gentoo in terms of flexibility but it is better than Ubuntu and Fedora, imho
2014-01-01 01:22:30	kitsunekitty	but then again the users of Arch or Gentoo arent the audience OpenSUSE really targets

2014-01-01 01:41:05	@bilbo	it is an animal product thought.
2014-01-01 01:41:08	SMBinFLA	no, it's dairy and an animal product
2014-01-01 01:41:11	SMBinFLA	just like eggs
2014-01-01 01:41:29	kitsunekitty	In many mystic circles in the past cheese was considered the blood and flesh purified for eating.  I believe this thought originated in the Vedas, but I think certain Pythagoran circles gave a similar explanation.
2014-01-01 01:41:30	SMBinFLA	but that's the difference between vegan and vegitarian

2014-01-01 02:07:00	kitsunekitty	^
2014-01-01 02:07:09	iamikon	so we are all purple
2014-01-01 02:07:25	@bilbo	well purple has a different already defined meaning xD
2014-01-01 02:07:41	iamikon	red + blue = purple gosh darn it!
2014-01-01 02:07:55	bunny	what about the blanks?
2014-01-01 02:08:10	Cobalt	Red + blue = FAB-U-LOUS!
2014-01-01 02:08:24	@bilbo	that is correct but it has a different meaning. It means that people aren't really polarized between the two parties. Not that the two parties necessarily do the same thing (though that is the logical contintutation of that line of thought ) :P
2014-01-01 02:08:25	locust	doesnt matter who's at the wheel when the bus is still driving over the cliff
2014-01-01 02:08:31	kitsunekitty	also, why is Red the conservative color in the US and blue the liberal color? That's <censored> backwards and generally when you say red most people associate that with Socialist / Communist movements or at least the left
2014-01-01 02:09:32	locust	why apply labels at all >.>
2014-01-01 02:09:33	@bilbo	kitsunekitty:  cause 'Murica.
2014-01-01 02:09:53	iamikon	bilbo: my logic means more than your 'definition' :P
2014-01-01 02:10:00	iamikon	or at least should lol
2014-01-01 02:10:04	@bilbo	and back in the day republicans were the crazy liberals, all against slavery and everything
2014-01-01 02:10:18	iamikon	bilbo: i was talking about that earlier
2014-01-01 02:10:43	iamikon	all notable good things our government has done was done by republicans... go figure
2014-01-01 02:11:07	@bilbo	I take it you are not a fan of FDR?
2014-01-01 02:11:35	iamikon	'all' being subjective and me being lazy
2014-01-01 02:11:57	@bilbo	anyway, on the topic of 'purple'. That is the natural evolution of the two part system. It has a moderating affect on politics. Two parties try to appeal to as broad a base as possible which leadds to very similar 'platforms' 
2014-01-01 02:12:23	kookieless	So who gonna join my political party

2014-01-01 02:12:27	@bilbo	though the party platform is becoming largely irrelevant due to how candidates are selected these days.
2014-01-01 02:12:35	locust	bring back the Whip!
2014-01-01 02:12:46	kookieless	Whigs?

2014-01-01 02:13:14	kookieless	purple is justice i believe actually
2014-01-01 02:13:32	locust	all i know is the stoner party is green
2014-01-01 02:13:49	kookieless	you mean the green party :p

2014-01-01 11:08:36	R0ss	I don't know what it is but  in ubuntu, unity looks a bit fuzzy. not as sharp as windows, or kde which I'm looking at now.
2014-01-01 11:08:59	sikory	I predict it will be 365 days long
2014-01-01 11:09:10	dysoco	might be the icons? for me the icons look fuzzy if their size is 11, 13 or 15, but not 12 14 or 16 for example

2014-01-01 11:13:35	dysoco	I hope it is
2014-01-01 11:13:39	BigC	that is, when mobile carriers decide to hop on the ubuntu train.
2014-01-01 11:15:01	BigC	but you have to give canonical credit for sort of spurring on innovation within the linux community

2014-01-01 11:18:51	BigC	i fully support canonical in there decision for a one unified experience on desktop, mobile, television, and any other paradigm they might decide to strive forward to
2014-01-01 11:19:17	R0ss	and no they won't fork the kernel.
2014-01-01 11:19:52	Holst	let's hope their unification isn't some tablet OS copy pasted over a desktop OS
2014-01-01 11:20:01	sikory	no, they'd write their own
2014-01-01 11:20:05	sikory	:p
2014-01-01 11:20:37	Holst	Let's hope they can unify them at all. (not easy seeing as each have specific functions and use
2014-01-01 11:20:46	R0ss	ha! someone made that prediction yesterday during unplugged...ummm, no. that wont be happeing in 2014
2014-01-01 11:20:48	Holst	I have my doubts personally.
2014-01-01 11:20:58	Holst	But I will wait and see.
2014-01-01 11:21:13	BigC	apple is trying to do the same thing, but there attempt is sort of half-a$$ed. microsoft is dying, and will continue to do so if they dont get their act together
2014-01-01 11:21:44	R0ss	I really like windows 7, can't stand 8.
2014-01-01 11:22:01	Holst	Same
2014-01-01 11:22:18	R0ss	they messed up with ME 2.0, then 7 came about, then they screw up again.
2014-01-01 11:22:45	R0ss	just now we have a huge issue because IE11 is causing Outlook 2003 emails to go out incomplete.
2014-01-01 11:23:01	Holst	R0ss, it's a very agressive bug going around these days
2014-01-01 11:23:17	Holst	called tabletitise
2014-01-01 11:23:35	Holst	It prevents devs from seeing beyond tablet style developement.
2014-01-01 11:23:41	BigC	Holst: tabletization?
2014-01-01 11:23:59	Holst	BigC, no no, that makes it sound good

2014-01-01 11:27:07	sikory	Holst: it seems so odd to me, since I assume those devs use desktops to develop
2014-01-01 11:27:14	BigC	i dont think though that unity will hinder people and the way that they work. specifically regular joe-user will still be able to access social media, email, and watch videos. however powerusers/developers will still be able to work properly. its not like canonical has decided to get rid of the terminal or anything.
2014-01-01 11:28:07	Holst	Unity I will admit (while I don't much care for it) is done a HELL of a lot better than Metro.
2014-01-01 11:28:16	BigC	+mir wont be shipping til at least 14.10
2014-01-01 11:28:17	Holst	but it still...bugs me in some ways
2014-01-01 11:28:34	Holst	that being said...unlike metro I AM interested in seeing what ubuntu come up with
2014-01-01 11:28:39	BigC	id rather use unity over metro any day
2014-01-01 11:28:51	sikory	that was close; I live in a former monastery and in that town a former monastery burned down today
2014-01-01 11:29:13	sikory	but it was one block away from my place
2014-01-01 11:30:57	Holst	BigC, Well, their goal has really always been to make a linux that is actually "user friendly"
2014-01-01 11:31:11	Holst	A big part of that is getting way from having to use the console
2014-01-01 11:31:32	Holst	then they have to sort out other...issues, big issues
2014-01-01 11:32:09	roasted	hello
2014-01-01 11:32:16	BigC	as far as i can tell, mac os as well as windows still have consoles
2014-01-01 11:32:27	Holst	BigC, indeed.
2014-01-01 11:32:46	roasted	ha, mir is pushed to 14.10?
2014-01-01 11:32:50	roasted	will ubuntu ever see mir?
2014-01-01 11:32:50	Holst	but in windows especially, you'll never have to use it as an average user
2014-01-01 11:32:54	Holst	even a power user
2014-01-01 11:33:41	roasted	I think Chris said it at some point in a prediction, which sounded like a sarcastic joke but one I legit LOL'd at. Prediction: Canonical will drop Mir for Wayland and say it was all a joke to light a fire under Wayland development. 
2014-01-01 11:33:47	BigC	but will there ever truely be a day when the console is not necessary?
2014-01-01 11:33:53	roasted	I hope not
2014-01-01 11:34:05	roasted	once you get used to a terminal it's amazing how much more efficient it is
2014-01-01 11:34:07	Holst	BigC, doubt it.
2014-01-01 11:34:29	BigC	and it also depends on how you/anybody defines what a "power user" actually is
2014-01-01 11:34:46	roasted	I could set up a samba file server (easy task anyway) in a hot second with terminal. I wouldn't want to use a gui for that.
2014-01-01 11:34:53	roasted	not fo rmany users and specific permissions etc.

2014-01-01 13:54:56	&rikai	Actually, there should be a setting in the bios to tell it which display to prefer as the primary display.
2014-01-01 13:55:15	techno	yes, but it's better done through the nvidia manager

2014-01-01 13:57:56	NEEDTOKNOW	so &rikai: you think bios?

2014-01-01 13:59:47	iamikon	It should all be able to be controlled via windows display settings and/or the nvidia control panel
2014-01-01 13:59:48	techno	yes
2014-01-01 13:59:57	&rikai	There are some improvments, but it's not a massive difference.

2014-01-01 14:32:55	ryan516|emacs	crshbndct: I just followed the Beginner's Guide directions, and the bug happened
2014-01-01 14:33:15	ryan516|emacs	So for now I'm just using Syslinux, which installed without an issue
2014-01-01 14:33:26	iamikon	I am slightly surprised that box-look.org doesn't have jwm. they have icewm and everything else though

2014-01-02 12:11:09	frostfire	naaa i liked c++
2014-01-02 12:11:21	frostfire	when i did only strucurall progaming in it.
2014-01-02 12:11:31	GreenLantern	c++, lisp, haskell and lolcode are the only languages worth learning.
2014-01-02 12:11:35	GreenLantern	:P
2014-01-02 12:11:41	frostfire	when i started oop i saw how much mess of it is
2014-01-02 12:11:55	frostfire	also with that altitude you wont achive much in the real world ;p
2014-01-02 12:12:11	frostfire	you use the framework your client wants not what you want.
2014-01-02 12:12:18	frostfire	unless you are a scientist
2014-01-02 12:12:19	sikory	everybody has a different idea of how they would implement stuff in C++, making it very hard to work with other people
2014-01-02 12:12:22	frostfire	then you use haskell ;p

2014-01-02 12:12:39	frostfire	sikory, this!
2014-01-02 12:12:47	sikory	unless you agree on some common subset, but then you should just pick C
2014-01-02 12:12:56	frostfire	yeah..
2014-01-02 12:12:57	Torikun	Object foo  = new Object();
2014-01-02 12:13:27	frostfire	Torikun, it's way too low leverl to be usefull for objective programming

2014-01-02 12:14:54	frostfire	and you can even do List<Object> listOfObjects = new List<Object>();
2014-01-02 12:15:36	sikory	given a line in C++, you have no idea which functions are all called (constructors, destructors etc) while in C it's obvious what happens
2014-01-02 12:15:55	sikory	since the function calls are actually written in the file

2014-01-02 13:11:54	guajiro	where do i pt it? i gather it doesn't go in fstab right?

2014-01-02 13:18:31	crshbndct	it would use more space if you are making snapshots
2014-01-02 13:18:51	Helio	cow always uses more space
2014-01-02 13:19:00	crshbndct	i keep a rolling update of 24 hourly snapshots
2014-01-02 13:19:07	crshbndct	oldest gets deleted
2014-01-02 13:19:16	Helio	relative to the total 'real' used space
2014-01-02 13:19:19	GreenLantern	I should start using snapshots..
2014-01-02 13:19:25	crshbndct	i have a super awesome script that does it for me
2014-01-02 13:20:06	crshbndct	Helio: yeah i can see why that would be, but not a huge significant amount more, surely?
2014-01-02 13:20:16	Helio	crshbndct: it depends upon your write profile
2014-01-02 13:20:39	guajiro	GreenLantern: i saw both of those, just neither was clear about if i should modify fstab... but i guess that's jst a given
2014-01-02 13:20:47	crshbndct	give me a few minutes to get out of bed and i will get my script for you
2014-01-02 13:20:54	Helio	crshbndct: if you are doing something like video editing and transcoding/deleting files, probably significant
2014-01-02 13:21:10	Helio	crshbndct: if you are making tiny file changes every so often, probably not anything to write home about

2014-01-02 13:21:44	guajiro	yea, i was thinking about having multiple .vdi's in home
2014-01-02 13:22:12	guajiro	but i still dont entirely understand what btrfs does exactly, other than make snap shots a breeze
2014-01-02 13:22:19	crshbndct	usage is simple "btrfs-snap / hourly 24" takes a snapshot of /, names it hourly (date) and if there are 24 existing snaps already, deletes the oldest one
2014-01-02 13:22:57	BigC	i found a snapper bug on opensuse.
2014-01-02 13:23:08	crshbndct	ahhh yeah for vm images btrfs is no good
2014-01-02 13:23:11	guajiro	BigC: pray tell
2014-01-02 13:23:16	Helio	guajiro: that'll do it
2014-01-02 13:23:34	Helio	guajiro: your write profile is probably pretty big, especially if those vdis are also big
2014-01-02 13:23:34	crshbndct	you know you can disable CoW per file or directory too?
2014-01-02 13:23:39	letkume	Anyone have any idea on getting netflix to function on linux?
2014-01-02 13:23:46	guajiro	yes
2014-01-02 13:24:02	BigC	if you extract a tar archive to the root directory, e.g. tar -xvzf file.tar.gz -C /  then your system will freak out and say that utilities in /bin or /sbin do not exist
2014-01-02 13:24:23	crshbndct	letkume: google pipelight
2014-01-02 13:24:36	letkume	I get an error on netflix-desktop: "N8156 6022"
2014-01-02 13:24:43	letkume	google whatnow?
2014-01-02 13:24:48	guajiro	BigC: hmmm...
2014-01-02 13:25:13	guajiro	BigC: in 13.1?
2014-01-02 13:25:18	BigC	guajiro: i did multiple tests and verified that it is indeed a snapper bug and not a btrfs bug
2014-01-02 13:25:20	BigC	yes
2014-01-02 13:25:32	guajiro	i see
2014-01-02 13:25:39	guajiro	thanks for the heads up
2014-01-02 13:25:40	BigC	if you uninstall snapper, tar -xvzf file.tar.gz -C / will work
2014-01-02 13:26:06	guajiro	i am finding opensuse 13.1 to be the best 'full featured' distro i've ever used
2014-01-02 13:27:11	BigC	i use opensuse 13.1 because i need to get stuff done. i like arch, however if i need to do something, and a piece of software breaks, then ... i am screwed.
2014-01-02 13:27:19	guajiro	far better than ubuntu for the 'power user' type of linux newbie
2014-01-02 13:27:19	crshbndct	letkume: netflix desktop is deprecated in favour of pipelight. also, locate and delete mspr.hds to get rid of that error. also, try not using irc as a mechanical turk googling service, you get the same result just putting the question in the google search box

2014-01-02 13:31:14	guajiro	but if she finds it too ugly i will switch it over to gnome or kde
2014-01-02 13:31:37	BigC	guajiro: i successfully upgraded from opensuse 12.3 to 13.1 using zypper dup. it was around 3900 packages. only 1 issue which was grub saying that it was 12.3 after i upgraded. 
2014-01-02 13:31:50	crshbndct	i would just install a start menu replacement and fix the slowness

2014-01-02 13:32:55	WWNSX	faster doesn't excuse the GUI
2014-01-02 13:32:57	GreenLantern	*actually
2014-01-02 13:33:04	Helio	systems that use COW are always vulnerable to this problem, you need to have enough free space to handle all writes before you can safely deallocate the orphaned data
2014-01-02 13:33:05	crshbndct	and linux is not ready for primetime in the desktop, unless you want to be seen as the nerd who screwed up her pc
2014-01-02 13:33:19	|	Helio designed a distributed COW database many moons ago
2014-01-02 13:33:35	Helio	the caveat is always that you need a lot of free disk space
2014-01-02 13:34:24	Helio	crshbndct: well, for data blocks themselves it probably turns of COW, but for metadata blocks like block pointers and such, it would make zero sense to make them non-cow
2014-01-02 13:34:42	Helio	because then you would need to add a fsck command that will take a long time to complete and may lose data
2014-01-02 13:34:47	Helio	which would be silly

I am under the impression that 7 must have been pretty bad as well. she also has a horrible propensity to install browser hijackers, uninstallable toolbars, and all other flavors of malware. so it think thi is the best way to go.
2014-01-02 13:35:58	Piece_Maker	letkume: have you changed browser user agent?

2014-01-02 13:36:44	Helio	guajiro: it's faster then 7 if you have a new enough processor to support all the sse stuff it does in the kernel

2014-01-02 13:48:00	Helio	guajiro: cool, it'll just cow metadata changes, which will be more consistant then a 'normal' filesystem anyway, nodatacow will give you the same data consistancy as a 'normal' filesystem

2014-01-02 13:50:00	crshbndct	credit to cwillu on #btrfs for that one
2014-01-02 13:50:03	Helio	yea, I have one for zfs, Allan has a real nice one for his zfs installs that does better data management of the snapshots
2014-01-02 13:51:01	crshbndct	i just have a cron job that goes off every hour to snapshot / and .home
2014-01-02 13:51:06	crshbndct	*/home
2014-01-02 13:51:26	crshbndct	and deletes the oldest one at the same time
2014-01-02 13:52:08	Helio	Allan's keeps every 10 minutes, then it keeps every hour, then it keeps every month, then every 6 months, then each year, and deletes checkpoints in between, it's really nice
2014-01-02 13:52:44	Helio	it gives you good 'oops' coverage when the changes were made, but then keeps the archive for your customers
2014-01-02 13:53:18	Helio	the one I have just keeps a snapshot every night, for 3 months, then deletes the old one
2014-01-02 13:53:28	Helio	*oldest one
2014-01-02 13:53:50	crshbndct	yeah mine could do the same if i told it to
2014-01-02 13:54:19	Helio	I think nodatacow would break snapshots, or make them much more expensive

2014-01-02 13:54:47	Helio	because instead of copying every write, and always having old data blocks, it would have to copy the files at snapshot creation
2014-01-02 13:56:24	crshbndct	doesnt i just skip the files/partitions that are set nodatacow in that case?

2014-01-02 14:05:07	Korlus	crshbndct: Can you turn off Copy on Write?
2014-01-02 14:05:25	Korlus	I've never thought to try. It seems like an integral feature.
2014-01-02 14:06:12	crshbndct	yeah you can, per file/dir/subvolume
2014-01-02 14:06:14	Helio	crshbndct: aye, better off using a plain filesystem at that point
2014-01-02 14:06:50	Korlus	I assume it makes things faster. Does it then compare with ext4 (etc) in use?
2014-01-02 14:07:01	crshbndct	I would think xfs for the VM images/data storage
2014-01-02 14:07:15	crshbndct	Korlus: btrfs is as fast as ext4 now
2014-01-02 14:07:24	crshbndct	if you use a current kernel, that is
2014-01-02 14:07:38	Korlus	crshbndct: I haven't tried it in the last six months. Six months ago it was about 30% slower. Is it really that fast? Or just in some use cases?
2014-01-02 14:08:02	crshbndct	it is the same for me
2014-01-02 14:08:14	crshbndct	raw transfer rates dont tell the whole story
2014-01-02 14:08:47	crshbndct	since most of the systems responsiveness comes from random reads/writes
2014-01-02 14:08:51	crshbndct	not sequential
2014-01-02 14:09:39	crshbndct	unless you are doing lots of large file transfers/video capture/etc, in which case CoW is not what you need anyway
2014-01-02 14:10:22	crshbndct	i should put it a different way: I switched to btrfs, and have not noticed any difference in speed at all other than one specific thing
2014-01-02 14:10:23	Korlus	crshbndct: While true, a lot of servers will roll out a CoW filesystem because they don't want their main server structure getting damaged, and they also handle video files (etc), and just use CoW for all data.

2014-01-02 14:12:00	Korlus	Going back six months, writing to btrfs from dev/random and to ext4 gave me something akin to 120 vs. 180 mbit/s on a hard drive

2014-01-02 14:12:53	crshbndct	ahh ok
2014-01-02 14:13:11	crshbndct	what sort of mechanical hard drive can achieve 180MB/s?
2014-01-02 14:13:19	Korlus	It's a single platter 1TB.
2014-01-02 14:13:29	crshbndct	in raid0?
2014-01-02 14:13:41	Korlus	No. It's blazingly fast in ext4, and only gets about 120mb/s under ntfs.
2014-01-02 14:13:54	Korlus	So btrfs and ntfs are about even on it.
2014-01-02 14:14:08	crshbndct	i suspect that you are being fooled by some sort of caching or something going on
2014-01-02 14:14:09	Korlus	It's a pretty nice hard drive :p
2014-01-02 14:14:27	Korlus	I ran the test for about three minutes. Not incredibly long, but long enough I would suspect?
2014-01-02 14:14:29	Korlus	I did it two or three times.
2014-01-02 14:15:17	crshbndct	i still wouldnt call that a definitive test

2014-01-02 16:41:24	Helio	ForeverA_Noob: ie, they boot off the network, copy everything to ram, do transactions, then have an offline mode to tolerate network hiccups

To call something linux, all it needs to do is to use the linux kernel. chrome os uses the linux kernel and is therefore linux based. BSD and OS X don't use the linux kernel, and therefore aren't linux-based, it's as simple as that.

2014-01-02 19:38:32	Helio	frostfire: that means you are actually being challenged now

2014-01-02 19:39:21	Helio	ugh, one of those comp sci courses
2014-01-02 19:39:24	BigC	he also said that if you had two windows open, and you wanted to move them, then you could take the title bar of one of them, and just start to drag it and your desktop would expand, hence the name 'infinite desktop'
2014-01-02 19:39:42	frostfire	Helio, heapsort, quicksort

2014-01-02 21:03:41	Linux-is-Unix	The FSF's ideology is obviously unsustainable at this point too. A lot of work remains to be done to be able to get serious work done with completely open source software
2014-01-02 21:03:49	ryan516	Because they're killing off XP, and their new versions of Windows just suck

2014-01-02 21:04:19	Cobalt	Unsustainable? I don't think so.
2014-01-02 21:04:25	crshbndct	IT professionals make up an insignificant part of earths population
2014-01-02 21:04:28	Linux-is-Unix	They are trying their hardest to sell this Metro interface, and a large number of people are not biting.
2014-01-02 21:04:47	Helio	crshbndct: yes, but it professionals and developers are far larger then the open source subset
2014-01-02 21:04:58	thriftyspend	eventually all of the worlds professions will be done better and cheaper by robots and computers

2014-01-02 23:03:15	woodjrx	I started on ubuntu, but when I dual-booted it, I never used it...  I got this laptop with win8.... and saw the arch  challenge video... and wiped it, installing arch

2014-01-02 23:03:27	woodjrx	and haven't looked back yet

2014-01-02 23:07:22	iamikon	woodjrx: that is the vanilla implentation. that is why opensuse/kde is suggested because it is integrated better and thus performs better

2014-01-03 00:10:22	bjh13	KingSphinx: You can't judge RAM in general like that.  OS X (and Windows 8 and other operatings systems) caches stuff in RAM while the system is under a light load to make loading programs faster.
2014-01-03 00:11:21	KingSphinx	I'm not just judging RAM usage here, I meant performance in general. OS X is nice for an average Joe, but not really ideal for gaming IMO.

2014-01-03 00:12:23	KingSphinx	Someone with too much money?
2014-01-03 00:12:25	bjh13	KingSphinx: Perhaps not at this point, but that mostly comes from an infamiliarity with the operating system for developers.  It's the same reason the PS3 sometimes felt clunkier than an Xbox 360.  OS X isn't a priority for games, so they will never feel as smooth as on Windows.
2014-01-03 00:12:34	@bilbo	OSX performs at least as well as Windows, the issue for gaming is more related to selection....
2014-01-03 00:12:54	Cobalt	Y'mean like Linux?

2014-01-03 00:14:23	bjh13	kookieless: People that get a Mac are more concerned with the interface and how the machine.  They don't even consider the alternative.

2014-01-03 00:16:15	KingSphinx	I also don't care too much for the App Store, seeing as how you need an Apple ID just to download stuff from it.
2014-01-03 00:16:18	kookieless	I'd rather build my own machine or get a custom built one from like cyberpower pc or ibuypower than a system 76 desktop
2014-01-03 00:16:43	bjh13	I own a mac for our family computer.  Every developer I've ever worked with has migrated to them.

2014-01-03 00:35:57	Linux-is-Unix	If you can't get the answer in the crunchbang forums or chatrooms, the Debian forums usually help
2014-01-03 00:35:59	iamikon	mollusk: I think it is showing a trend in a bad way. All of these new coins coming out. they even have a kanye west coin. its kind of turning into a joke

2014-01-03 00:36:43	iamikon	seems like people are taking this thing that could have been awesome and purposefully trying to make it look like a joke

2014-01-03 01:48:24	KingSphinx	I do have to wonder: who would install KDE on OS X? It's apparently available through MacPorts...
2014-01-03 01:50:24	iamikon	That is a rather interesting idea. Maybe do it just to see how it works. I tried installing the KDE stuff on windoze once

2014-01-03 10:55:32	Korlus	Holst: The point I was making before is that the fault rarely lies with the source upstream, but with somebody who has interacted with it since then. The less your distro fiddles with things (default settings etc) the greater the chance the end user made the mistake. The downside with that is that usually the end user knows less than the distro makers do. :p

2014-01-03 10:59:46	Korlus	Holst: You verified the disk vs. The checksum after burning the install medium?
2014-01-03 10:59:57	Holst	every time.
2014-01-03 11:00:05	Korlus	Paddy: You can't just recertify it? O.o
2014-01-03 11:00:11	Holst	and on different machines too sometimes
2014-01-03 11:00:36	hoppingmadpaddy	Korlus: would take more work to try and patch it, rather then redo the whole thing
2014-01-03 11:01:04	sikory	wow, you actually tried 50 times
2014-01-03 11:01:13	hoppingmadpaddy	Korlus: I have done plenty of projects like that during my study time, it isn't that bad
2014-01-03 11:01:19	Korlus	Holst: Could easily be a problem with how you're burning the disks (etc). E.g: If you are using an SD card and integrated writer on a laptop, they often won't allow the kind of write access required.
2014-01-03 11:01:21	sikory	at least

2014-01-03 11:02:56	Korlus	Anyway, must get back to work for a bit. Ought to be done in a few hours.

2014-01-04 20:21:37	Helio	yea, compared to new york there was not as much to do, the pentagon was built to withstand an attack, so everything was compartmentalized
2014-01-04 20:21:39	@q5sys	Helio: the craziest part... I had JUST sworn into the USAF the friday before.
2014-01-04 20:21:53	Helio	he told me the weirdest thing he saw was one of the plane engines, the only one to survive
2014-01-04 20:22:07	kitsunekitty	isn't most of the Pentagon actually underground, anyways?
2014-01-04 20:22:09	Helio	it got wedged between two of the slices
2014-01-04 20:22:25	Helio	kitsunekitty: not quite
2014-01-04 20:22:43	@q5sys	was due to ship out to basic in two weeks, but once that happened I got pushed back to December, because the air force wanted to pull in mechanical enlistees instead of medical.
2014-01-04 20:22:45	Helio	kitsunekitty: there is a large underground complex, but the top has employees
2014-01-04 20:23:08	Helio	kitsunekitty: the entrance for high value targets is underground iirc
2014-01-04 20:24:04	Helio	q5sys: wow
2014-01-04 20:24:55	Helio	he actually managed to get pieces of the plane, he's shown them to me once, not much was left but tiny bits of steel
2014-01-04 20:26:50	Helio	the engine survived purely by chance, and took out most of the divider on that section with it
2014-01-04 20:29:02	@q5sys	it'd be nice if some of that photography woudl be released to quell the 'conspiracy' people

2014-01-04 20:33:25	Helio	that's why I said he was angry and humble at the same time

2014-01-04 20:37:18	iamikon	q5sys: decided on the kudu professional
2014-01-04 20:37:25	kitsunekitty	Helio, i don't think AJ is lying.  He seems to firmly believe his own BS.  To say he is lying is to accuse him of knowing it is bogus
2014-01-04 20:38:14	kitsunekitty	he is just ignorant and has a poor understanding of science and a mistrust in authority that leads into full blown paranoia
2014-01-04 20:38:25	@q5sys	iamikon: ah cool
2014-01-04 20:38:33	Helio	kitsunekitty: I'm not 100% convinced it's not an act, limbaugh is definately an act, I got that from the source, but AJ may or may not be
2014-01-04 20:38:44	@q5sys	kitsunekitty: I think he sees himself as an 'entertainer' and thus... its not lying
2014-01-04 20:39:07	kitsunekitty	Limbaugh admitted he only shills for conservatives for the money
2014-01-04 20:39:17	kitsunekitty	he stated it in a book in the early 90s
2014-01-04 20:40:02	Helio	kitsunekitty: I know, one of our staffers was a diehard conservative and knew him through a couple of his better connected friends, and didn't like the man either

2014-01-04 21:30:03	Helio	which they did, and put him on a blood work check
2014-01-04 21:30:07	iamikon	HURD in the hood!
2014-01-04 21:30:29	iamikon	woodjrx: lithium is dangerous stuff
2014-01-04 21:30:43	crshbndct	iamikon: how so?
2014-01-04 21:30:51	Helio	yea, I don't think lithium would be a good idea
2014-01-04 21:31:01	iamikon	how is lithium dangerous? it is basically a medicinal labotomy
2014-01-04 21:31:20	crshbndct	afaik, it is still the "gold standard" of mood stabilisers
2014-01-04 21:31:21	Helio	he's hard to med manage, and lithium requires more management
2014-01-04 21:31:29	crshbndct	interesting
2014-01-04 21:31:30	iamikon	crshbndct: it hasn't been for a long time
2014-01-04 21:31:37	woodjrx	True; albeit not that hard / dangerous
2014-01-04 21:31:48	iamikon	crshbndct: lithium is more of an extreme measure at this point
2014-01-04 21:31:49	Cobalt	crshbndct: Huh?
2014-01-04 21:31:52	woodjrx	It is the gold standard still
2014-01-04 21:32:04	crshbndct	they were still prescribing it ahead of everything else over here up until a year ago
2014-01-04 21:32:21	Cobalt	I just admitted that I'm weird and that I use Debian Wheezy. What more do you want?!
2014-01-04 21:32:35	iamikon	crshbndct: They effect on the mood/mental capacity was determined too much a few years ago.
2014-01-04 21:32:44	iamikon	for the general perscriptions that they were giving out
2014-01-04 21:32:54	Helio	woodjrx: for long term care maybe, but they told us that it was a last resort medication as well
2014-01-04 21:33:18	Helio	we asked if he was able, they told us he needed frequent blood work

2014-01-04 21:33:45	woodjrx	Helio:  Makes sense.  Each medication (for anything) is a controlled poision - making something work in a different way.
2014-01-04 21:34:01	woodjrx	Yeah, usually every 3 months, once it's to a therapeutic level
2014-01-04 21:34:30	iamikon	I am not even sure what we are talking about but I do know lithium is pretty much a last resort for anything anymore.
2014-01-04 21:34:31	crshbndct	iamikon: I am not sure i believe you
2014-01-04 21:34:33	Helio	yea, but it's like weekly before that, and you have to change it when you move because of build up
2014-01-04 21:34:35	woodjrx	Lithium is an ion, and it replaces sodium.  So you predominately have to worry about how much water they are drinking.  If they stop drinking but keep taking it, it can quickly become toxic
2014-01-04 21:34:38	iamikon	crshbndct: thats fine lol
2014-01-04 21:34:45	crshbndct	unless they upped the minimum dose from 200 to 2000mg
2014-01-04 21:35:08	woodjrx	iamikon:  You're probably thinking about clozapine
2014-01-04 21:35:09	Helio	woodjrx: isn't it also affected by water supply differences for the same reason?
2014-01-04 21:35:26	Helio	and yea, that would be bad for him
2014-01-04 21:35:38	iamikon	crshbndct: it could be different in diffrent states/countries but in WA lithium is not prescribed except as a last resort because it has that labotomy effect on a lot of people
2014-01-04 21:35:43	Helio	sometimes he drinks two gallons of water, other days he's like a camel
2014-01-04 21:35:57	iamikon	woodjrx: no I am thinking of lithium but also I only know about my area not everywhere else

2014-01-04 21:37:14	Helio	woodjrx: ah, ok
2014-01-04 21:37:38	woodjrx	I've seen someone up and walking & talking after taking 150mg of benadryl...  The ones you get over the counter are 25mg.
2014-01-04 21:37:40	iamikon	The most notable case I can think of is Mike Tyson, when he was all lucid and half retarded he was on lithium, he is no longer on it and actually a half way intelligent guy.
2014-01-04 21:38:04	iamikon	woodjrx: yeah I can take a ton of benadryl and not get drowsy, different people always have different reactions
2014-01-04 21:38:10	woodjrx	I thought Mike was due to the cocaine?  (haven't followed him... ever)
2014-01-04 21:38:17	iamikon	woodjrx: I guess it is just my area that they decided that, I really don't know that much
2014-01-04 21:38:30	iamikon	woodjrx: the lucid retardedness was due to lithium

2014-01-04 21:40:54	iamikon	I probably shouldn't be in this discussion lol, I am of the mindset that all these medications cause more problems than they help
2014-01-04 21:41:19	Cobalt	iamikon: I agree.

2014-01-04 21:41:43	iamikon	Cobalt: there is a reason countries like Japan have 1% cancer rates and Murrica has some ridiculously high %

2014-01-04 21:43:05	iamikon	Helio: it is really amazing the difference in doctors, if you don't think his doctor is doing enough/ the right thin you're probably right and should take him somewhere else
2014-01-04 21:43:09	woodjrx	Yeah.  Unfortunately, most insurance companies don't support paying for therapy, which only worsens this "take this pill, it'll make you better" - when it's only one part of a treatment
2014-01-04 21:43:26	iamikon	crshbndct: what would you consider the difference then?

2014-01-04 21:47:23	Helio	no, that's my bad, the quotes made it sound like I wasn't referring to him as an adult, it was referring to the fact that because I am partiallly paying for his care, and have to manage his health care because he is not of sound mind to do so himself in those cases, I have no control over that
2014-01-04 21:47:39	WWNSX_	Jimmy Fallon is a NBC shill
2014-01-04 21:47:47	crshbndct	iamikon: no you cannot. it is a logical fallacy to do that, and would not be acceptable in any actual research. otherwise I could also say that car accidents cause terrorist attacks, childbirth causes hurricanes and food causes weather changes

2014-01-04 21:48:37	Helio	we're as a society so concerned about pretending to protect patient privacy and an individuals personal rights to self governence that we put up barriers that harm the recovery of said person

2014-01-04 21:50:46	woodjrx	Helio:  You can - as a family member, you're not bound by HIPAA; the doctor just can't tell you anything.  That being said, it probably might cause a schism between you and him if you did, though

2014-01-04 21:58:19	crshbndct	i actually had an interesting conversation with a guy who had had the identical thing that i had(a hernia) and in my case i got it fixed, and in his case he got it fixed, lost his house, lost his job and had to move back in with his parents because he is financially ruined for the next 5-10 years over it

2014-01-04 22:51:28	crshbndct	so you can look for reviews of that
2014-01-04 22:51:49	kitsunekitty	yeah, I kinda wish Matt would be a stronger co-host.  I really like it when he does go on tangents and gives the contrarian opinion and whatnot.
2014-01-04 22:51:58	kitsunekitty	he just needs to do it more often
2014-01-04 22:52:05	iamikon	crshbndct: Yeah I couldn't find a single review of the Kudu

2014-01-04 22:52:41	kitsunekitty	sometimes I feel like Matt is trying to channel Tim "The Toolman" Taylor with the grunts

2014-01-05 01:02:09	crshbndct	thats quite good actually
2014-01-05 01:03:36	crshbndct	in reality it is similiar to baseball, bowler throws ball to batsman, he hits it and attempts to score by running, and can be out if the fielder gets the ball to a certain spot before the batsman can run there

2014-01-05 02:30:56	guajiro	ok
2014-01-05 02:31:43	guajiro	so, I installed linux on a machine for someone, and went to install it and the network was acting funny, so i pulled out all the cables and hardware and fixed everything up nice...
2014-01-05 02:31:50	bunny	hoppingmadpaddy will understand in my place
2014-01-05 02:32:06	guajiro	...installed opensuse, everything worked. then the internet quit working....
2014-01-05 02:32:14	hoppingmadpaddy	it is very early to understand anything
2014-01-05 02:32:53	guajiro	i couldn't figure out why, and had linux mint live usb handy  to show her that, so i pluged in mint and it worked again
2014-01-05 02:33:06	guajiro	now it doesnt
2014-01-05 02:33:13	hoppingmadpaddy	you did something wrong, would be my guess ....

2014-01-05 02:33:29	bunny	did a cat touch the keyboard?
2014-01-05 02:33:41	guajiro	here's the catch: It detects the wireless and connects, and it detects the ethernet and connects, loopback pings fine, but no internet
2014-01-05 02:34:06	guajiro	however, my laptop connects to the same ethernet cable and same wifi, and internet works

2014-01-05 02:35:57	guajiro	now, the wifi card didn't work on opensuse
2014-01-05 02:36:22	Cobalt	That's not too surprising.
2014-01-05 02:36:34	guajiro	but it did succesful work on int if im not mistaken, or at least it's detected and connects
2014-01-05 02:37:01	guajiro	but how could it work on my machine with the ame cable
2014-01-05 02:37:13	guajiro	then again, i run arch

2014-01-05 11:50:54	Helio	I was more looking at the fact that it's not two cpus with ccnuma, which may be an issue, may not, that is something that /definately/ would have to be tested before you could make an informed decision

2014-01-05 11:53:05	Helio	packet routing is not something that's as cpu heavy as it is memory io heavy, at least in terms of each packet being processed
2014-01-05 11:53:37	Helio	that's why high end routers have asic microcontrollers doing a lot of the grunt work on the packets under the direction of the main cpus

Most people have experience of Windows XP, you can't just expect them to switch to Gnome if it does not make sense.  Imagine asking a Model T driver to drive a Toyota Yaris.

2014-01-05 16:32:40	@q5sys_netbook	Helio: the reason you cant do searching and indexing on the same machine is that the RPi doesnt have the necessary power to do both at the same time.
2014-01-05 16:32:53	@q5sys_netbook	indexing maxes out the unit... which means its somewhat unresponsive if you're trying to search at the same time.

2014-01-05 17:15:15	Helio	there are two blobs I know of, the atheros supplied blob, and the reverse engineered one that openbsd was working on
2014-01-05 17:15:25	Hwkiller	i wasn't aware i even had firmware installed actually.
2014-01-05 17:15:44	Helio	there may be more blobs floating around

2014-01-05 17:16:19	Helio	Hwkiller: whether you are aware or not, the driver has to load the code for the transciever into the chip before it will do anything :)

2014-01-05 17:17:01	|	Helio notes, why they couldn't make wireless cards act like any other device in the system, is beyond me
2014-01-05 17:17:03	Hwkiller	Helio: care to link me to where it requires firmware? (or closed firmware? i just don't see it)
2014-01-05 17:17:11	iamikon	I use dhclient and a /etc/hostname.athn0 config with the ssid
2014-01-05 17:17:14	Hwkiller	or, link me to where it says you need the firmware*

2014-01-05 17:20:22	Helio	looks like before the qualcomm buyout, atheros released a 'free' firmware that was clean roomed from the closed firmware blob, but it doesn't say anything about the chips released after the buyout

2014-01-05 17:33:37	sikory	there are devs who don't use what they make?
2014-01-05 17:33:38	Helio	specifically, they all stay on -current, and don't use release branches
2014-01-05 17:33:48	iamikon	sikory: that is what I was thinking
2014-01-05 17:33:54	Helio	that's why openbsd doesn't have any really

2014-01-05 17:34:22	Helio	they also don't do anything that can't be tested and working within the 6 month cycle
2014-01-05 17:34:37	crshbndct	iamikon: i was looking at the s76 machines
2014-01-05 17:34:40	Helio	(actually, within the 4 month cycle, since they do cd mastering)
2014-01-05 17:34:50	crshbndct	is there any reason why you need the 17" display?
2014-01-05 17:35:01	iamikon	crshbndct: no not really at all

2014-01-05 17:35:22	Helio	if it doesn't work, it doesn't go into -current, or it gets reverted before release; they are very anal about that
2014-01-05 17:35:25	sikory	iamikon: is it?
2014-01-05 17:35:46	sikory	yes, they have limited resources, so they work on one branch only
2014-01-05 17:35:46	Helio	which means that the system rarely gets a lot of big changes or sexy features
2014-01-05 17:35:49	crshbndct	because galago ultrapro has all the specs the same, but with iris pro (hd 5200+128MB L4) for the same price
2014-01-05 17:35:52	iamikon	sikory: yeah as of right now updating from 5.4 to current is a lesson in disaster control

2014-01-05 17:36:28	crshbndct	lower base clock, but only .2GHz lower boost clock
2014-01-05 17:36:51	crshbndct	yeah.. when i looked i configured with 8GB, i cant see the point of 16 on a laptop
2014-01-05 17:36:53	Helio	there will be a specific upgrade path for 5.4 to 5.5
2014-01-05 17:36:54	iamikon	crshbndct: the kudu I only setup with the 'slowest' i7 and 16gb ram
2014-01-05 17:37:08	iamikon	crshbndct: because I could with the price differenc
2014-01-05 17:37:11	iamikon	difference*
2014-01-05 17:37:24	iamikon	that is the only reason really lol
2014-01-05 17:37:31	Helio	changing the width of a primitive type that's used everywhere in the system tends to point out bugs

2014-01-05 17:38:21	crshbndct	and more importantly, GPU memory bandwidth. 
2014-01-05 17:38:22	crshbndct	yes
2014-01-05 17:38:29	sikory	at least they have everybody working on the same branch, so the stuff should be ironed out relatively quicky
2014-01-05 17:38:37	iamikon	I still have a hard time paying that much for an ultrabook without a backlit keyboard, I know it sounds ridiculous but
2014-01-05 17:38:46	Helio	sikory: yes, because everyone is seeing the same bugs

2014-01-05 18:38:58	Helio	samsung is a conglomerate, they are made up of several completely independent companies under the samsung conglomerate board, with varying levels of oversight and quality control

2014-01-05 18:44:10	~ChrisLAS	Laptop challenges iamikon?
2014-01-05 18:44:38	iamikon	ChrisLAS: debating the Kudu/Galago
2014-01-05 18:44:52	iamikon	was wondering your opinions since you had them both in house for so long
2014-01-05 18:45:00	~ChrisLAS	Ya I think you signed off when I was thinking about that on the stream..
2014-01-05 18:45:06	~ChrisLAS	It comes down to whats more important
2014-01-05 18:45:11	~ChrisLAS	Weight, and graphics. 
2014-01-05 18:45:13	Helio	iamikon: the worst part, was they were aware of the defect before we did our first rma; they weren't going to replace the boards or fix any heat dissipation issues at first; we had one go back 3 times for replacement; I guess they realized they were losing more money by not revising the board
2014-01-05 18:45:14	iamikon	Helio: samsung always makes some horrible decisions but ends up with good hardware eventually
2014-01-05 18:45:19	~ChrisLAS	Or screensize and keyboard lighting
2014-01-05 18:45:21	@q5sys_netbook	ChrisLAS: I found a new system for you to demo... http://www.shopfujitsu.com/store/lifebook-u904-ultrabook  14", Widescreen, Ultra High-Definition, QHD+, 3200 X 1800, Capacitive Multi-touch Screen
2014-01-05 18:45:24	@q5sys_netbook	lol
2014-01-05 18:45:33	~ChrisLAS	My self? I would go with the Ultrapro with out hesitation
2014-01-05 18:45:40	~ChrisLAS	When we took them out of the box 
2014-01-05 18:45:44	~ChrisLAS	The Ultrapro was stunning
2014-01-05 18:45:47	Helio	iamikon: eventually though, they started replacing the boards with a later rev, and they stopped being rmad
2014-01-05 18:45:50	~ChrisLAS	Grabbed me the moment we put them on the table
2014-01-05 18:46:11	iamikon	ChrisLAS: yeah NFL playoffs lol, I know but I am having a hard time deciding because the Kudu is too big but has backlit and is cheaper, the Galago has the iris and is more future proof /lightweight
2014-01-05 18:46:11	Helio	iamikon: they also would /not/ let us preemptively send laptops with bad boards so they could be replaced before failure; we had to wait
2014-01-05 18:46:12	~ChrisLAS	The Kudu is great, but the HD4000 is a bit too much of a compromise for me
2014-01-05 18:46:31	Helio	iamikon: I won't voluntarily subject myself to that again :p
2014-01-05 18:46:34	~ChrisLAS	And the UtraPro's screen is super sharp, since its 1080p on that 14.1 IPS display
2014-01-05 18:46:45	iamikon	ChrisLAS: I thought they had the same display?
2014-01-05 18:47:02	isthatme	iamikon: the ultrapro's is smaller
2014-01-05 18:47:03	~ChrisLAS	When you combine that surprisingly decent graphics and the light weight, and the performance. UltraPro is a great package.
2014-01-05 18:47:06	isthatme	so it looks sharper
2014-01-05 18:47:28	iamikon	ChrisLAS: yeah I suppose a keyboard is a relatively minor thing to get so worked up about lol
2014-01-05 18:47:35	~ChrisLAS	iamikon Same resolution, the the UltraPro has a smaller screen, so the picture is really tight and brilliant

2014-01-05 21:19:39	crshbndct	like so: which lspci
2014-01-05 21:22:16	ryan516	crshbndct: I'm just taking notes right now, I'm on arch :P
2014-01-05 21:22:31	elstevi-red	iamikon: I am really happy with openbsd. I was able to do some scripting where it sets my backlight when it turns on, and i got a nice slim theme with the freebsd logo
2014-01-05 21:22:39	elstevi-red	Feeling very openbsd happy today
2014-01-05 21:22:40	ryan516	I know you're supposed to know that for the LPIC-1
2014-01-05 21:22:42	crshbndct	ryan516: which works on any distro
2014-01-05 21:22:49	crshbndct	try it
2014-01-05 21:23:06	ryan516	I just need to know what it does on Fedora/CentOS/RHEL :P
2014-01-05 21:23:31	crshbndct	i am not sure, i know on gentoo it is /sbin
2014-01-05 21:23:46	iamikon	elstevi-red: yeah it works amazingly well on the eeepc lol, once/if you switch to 32bit itll be even better cuz it won't be so hot and the fan will spin down :P
2014-01-05 21:23:56	ryan516	For some reason I thought the Kernel got rid of /sbin :P
2014-01-05 21:24:06	crshbndct	but if you are doing LPIC, it will probably pay to actually use one of the LSB distros, fedora 19 is your best bet
2014-01-05 21:24:11	crshbndct	the kernel?
2014-01-05 21:24:27	ryan516	Doesn't the Kernel handle FS?
2014-01-05 21:24:28	Helio	that's the path environment variable

2014-01-05 21:24:39	Helio	has fsck all to do with the kernel
2014-01-05 21:24:52	elstevi-red	I guess it wouldn't be much to export the installed packages and copy my home folder
2014-01-05 21:25:00	elstevi-red	export a list anyway
2014-01-05 21:25:32	ryan516	crshbndct: Would CentOS work?
2014-01-05 21:25:35	Helio	there are only a few folders or files the kernel typically cares about
2014-01-05 21:25:41	ryan516	I'm pretty sure it follows LSB standards
2014-01-05 21:25:49	crshbndct	i just mean for everything, if you are doing a linux certification that is primarily targeted at redhat/fedora, it is better to be running that so that you can do things like "which lspci" rather than just asking the chatroom 1000001 questions
2014-01-05 21:25:52	Helio	and that is usually init, and sometimes the runtime linker
2014-01-05 21:26:11	iamikon	elstevi-red: honestly it wasn't that big of a deal but I am a nitpicky kind of guy :) what WM did you decide to use?

2014-01-05 22:44:22	bjh13	bilbo: Because the 10th got a second go of it.
2014-01-05 22:44:36	@bilbo	he was still the 10th doctor, he just had a second regeneration.
2014-01-05 22:44:47	@bilbo	Capaldi will still be the 13th doctor.

2014-01-05 22:45:48	@bilbo	bjh13,  yeah but if we want to get technical he is the 13th, the 'War Doctor' doesn't really count though, you are right.
2014-01-05 22:45:57	@bilbo	bunny,  no one has disputed this fact :P
2014-01-05 22:46:13	bunny	queen of bacon > any # doctor
2014-01-05 22:46:27	bjh13	bilbo: He should count, but we've been calling Eccelston, Tennant, and Smith the 9th-11th Doctors for years now, so no one will go with it.
2014-01-05 22:46:46	bjh13	Hurt was awesome.
2014-01-05 22:47:00	@q5sys	the whole 'war doctor' though is kinda lame now... because he 'didn't do it' so... he's not what he was.
2014-01-05 22:47:05	@bilbo	he was OK.
2014-01-05 22:47:09	bjh13	Though I really wish we would get more Paul McGann, Night of the Doctor was brilliant.

2014-01-05 22:47:23	@bilbo	q5sys,  but the 9/10th doctors don't know that so they are, they still think they are at least
2014-01-05 22:47:52	@q5sys	bilbo: that whole storyline really became a mess... great idea... but horrible execution in my mind.
2014-01-05 22:48:15	@q5sys	there was something edgy and appealing about a doctor who say 'F the rules' and REALLY did F them over.
2014-01-05 22:48:27	@q5sys	and that he was rejected by the other doctors... that was cool.
2014-01-05 22:48:34	@bilbo	well it was kind of hacky. Moffat wanted to change everything but he couldn't change the show we've already watched so he came up with an excuse at the very end of the episode xD
2014-01-05 22:48:49	bjh13	It worked for me.
2014-01-05 22:49:04	bjh13	More than I could say for Time of the Doctor
2014-01-05 22:49:12	@q5sys	and I didnt like that they broke their own storyline with that episode.
2014-01-05 22:49:25	bjh13	q5sys: How did they break it?
2014-01-05 22:50:15	@bilbo	so I finally updgraded from my old Gameboy Color, I got me a Nintendo 3DS xD
2014-01-05 22:50:25	@q5sys	bjh13: did you watch the double episode with Tennent and the Master?  When the Time Lords almost came back with Rassilon
2014-01-05 22:51:01	bjh13	q5sys: Yep, and that all occured not long before the Gallifrey stuff in Day of the Doctor.  The general guy actually mentions it.
2014-01-05 22:51:11	@q5sys	in that prior storyline with Tennents Doctor... The Doctor already knew that the Time Lords were not 'killed' they were simply put in another dimension after being timelocked.
2014-01-05 22:51:29	@q5sys	so why then in the War doctor episode did they get this crazy idea of 'hey lets not kill them all'
2014-01-05 22:51:34	@bilbo	thats not entirely true q5sys  :P
2014-01-05 22:51:44	@q5sys	tennent already knew they werent killed, and by extension so did Smith's.
2014-01-05 22:52:16	bjh13	q5sys: He didn't.  He thought they were dead.  The Rassilon stuff all involved pulling Gallifrey from the past through the time lock, not from another dimension.
2014-01-05 22:52:44	Helio	and that's why I haven't watched doctor who
2014-01-05 22:52:48	bjh13	q5sys: The whole Moment thing would have happened to Gallifrey shortly after what Rassilon and the high council attempted.
2014-01-05 22:53:30	@q5sys	bjh13: from my understanding of the timeline... that's not correct.
2014-01-05 22:53:37	@bilbo	q5sys,  bjh13  is correct :P
2014-01-05 22:53:42	@q5sys	but I'd have to go back and rewatch the entire 2005 series straight through
2014-01-05 22:53:54	@bilbo	the two episodes are happening basically concurrently.
2014-01-05 22:54:03	Helio	a show with a 30 some odd season history is bound to be so damened convoluted and confusing
2014-01-05 22:54:16	@q5sys	Helio: except these storylines are really only from the last 7 years
2014-01-05 22:54:23	@q5sys	well... the detail in them at least
2014-01-05 22:54:25	bjh13	q5sys: Then you should watch the episodes again.  You would just need to watch that two parter and Day of the Doctor.
2014-01-05 22:54:49	@q5sys	bjh13: you sure?  becuase Eccelston talks about it as well.
2014-01-05 22:55:02	@q5sys	and Tennent does a few times with Billie

2014-01-05 22:55:15	@bilbo	q5sys,  rasillon is trying to break out of the time lock to avoid the Doctor destroying the timelords, what he doesn't know is that he is probably going to get tossed into another dimension by the doctor.
2014-01-05 22:55:48	bjh13	bilbo: Exactly.  And the general guy mentions how the High Council was mad and their plan failed.
2014-01-05 22:55:56	bjh13	So it happened right before Day of the Doctor

2014-01-05 22:57:43	@q5sys	it'd be nice if Moffett would put out an actual linear timeline of episodes... so you know what order they happen in. lol
2014-01-05 22:57:44	bjh13	Heck, the 50th anniversary special made a fortune in the theaters after it already aired on TV.
2014-01-05 22:57:47	@bilbo	I think convoluted plots is part of any show featuring time travel as a central plot device.
2014-01-05 22:57:52	@q5sys	like chronologically from our viewpoint
2014-01-05 22:59:04	Strengths	Helio: there's plenty of stuff that's been forgotten along the way. So many curent episodes have them "lose" the TARDIS so it can't play a part in the episode
2014-01-05 22:59:19	Fyksen	I have just watched the recent LAS episode,wandering about switching fulltime to arch on my desktop. I have it on my laptop with antegros, but my laptop doesn't have the horsepower for games.. How is Arch handling steamgames now? Does it work "out of the box" with most games, or do we still have to disable steam overlay and stuff to get things working right? : )
2014-01-05 22:59:19	Strengths	but the third Doctor's watch could home in on it

2014-01-05 22:59:50	Helio	bilbo: I'm talking about shows in general; anytime a show has more then just 'all episodes exist in a bubble' and has episodes that follow each other with arcs, it eventually will get weighed down by the plot
2014-01-05 23:00:09	@bilbo	Strengths,  but what if you lose the watch? :P
2014-01-05 23:00:29	Helio	bilbo: it's inevitable, especially with the amount of writers and showrunner changes that occur in modern television
2014-01-05 23:00:44	Strengths	bilbo: same thing as when you lose the sonic screwdriver, build a new damn one :P

2014-01-06 00:48:05	Linux-is-Unix	Let them state their positions unambiguously
2014-01-06 00:48:15	Linux-is-Unix	It will show people what they actually are
2014-01-06 00:48:23	mjayk	indeed
2014-01-06 00:48:31	mjayk	like when we had the BNP on the telly in the UK
2014-01-06 00:48:42	mjayk	he made such an arse out of himself
2014-01-06 00:48:54	Linux-is-Unix	The BNP are good entertainment :p
2014-01-06 00:48:57	mjayk	if they had not let him on, like they were going to, he would have gotten so many more followers
2014-01-06 00:49:19	mjayk	Linux-is-Unix: thats true
2014-01-06 00:49:54	kitsunekitty	Linux-is-Unix, that's good and all until a bunch of redneck shotgun-fascists take over your county or state and decide to make things difficult for certain races and whatnot.

2014-01-06 00:51:10	mjayk	nad everyone you live with

2014-01-06 00:51:24	Linux-is-Unix	How do they make social mobility almost impossible? You pretend like the KKK has political power
2014-01-06 00:51:27	mjayk	oh wait sorry are you from America ?

2014-01-06 00:54:16	Cobalt	Sometimes they want a certain version.
2014-01-06 00:54:28	mjayk	of a lib ?
2014-01-06 00:54:30	Cobalt	So a rolling release wouldn't solve the problem.
2014-01-06 00:54:51	kitsunekitty	Cobalt, fake it out by creating a pointer that works a lot of the time
2014-01-06 00:54:51	mjayk	why are you compliling bins anyway most stuff is in repos now a days right ?
2014-01-06 00:55:10	Cobalt	If it's in the repo, it's fine.
2014-01-06 00:55:18	Cobalt	And I'm not necessarily compiling.
2014-01-06 00:55:45	iamikon	Cobalt: use gentoo/freebsd with ports you can specify the exact version you want for any program/library

2014-01-06 00:57:39	iamikon	 obviously I am joking, Cobalt it is just the difference in the way things are installed, you can use pc-bsd with pbi's they are just like windows packages/included libraries

2014-01-06 00:58:52	kitsunekitty	Linux-is-Unix, anyways, I just don't think that an institution that promotes creationism in their biology courses should be allowed to call themselves a University... then again, I also dont believe education should be entrusted to private institutions in general because education should not be determined by what social class one is born into

2014-01-06 00:59:55	Linux-is-Unix	I don't think institutions should be government regulated. Then again, I see that the State is just a bunch of criminals threatening violence.

2014-01-06 01:00:57	mjayk	to be fair in the USA its quite good for students
2014-01-06 01:01:00	kitsunekitty	"the State" isn't some nebulous entity without a face.  it is controlled by the people... or should be.  when it is not controlled by the people it is only because of apathy
2014-01-06 01:01:01	slips	just curious
2014-01-06 01:01:09	Linux-is-Unix	I try to be a realist and idealist as much as possible.
2014-01-06 01:01:10	mjayk	i heard a us person complain that the average student debt was $21 k
2014-01-06 01:01:11	mjayk	i loled
2014-01-06 01:01:18	Cobalt	I kind of think that a lot of what makes Linux relatively secure is its disparity and inability to run almost everything that isn't in the repo.
2014-01-06 01:01:39	mjayk	Cobalt: Linux can run anything
2014-01-06 01:01:42	Linux-is-Unix	If it's controlled by the people, why do they bomb weddings without my consent?

2014-01-06 02:10:36	mjayk	kitsunekitty: it depends how you set your system up so how you define your problem such as in shors algorithm the problem would be set up so you would need more bits right
2014-01-06 02:10:53	mjayk	it also depends on what type of qbits you use
2014-01-06 02:11:12	mjayk	so photons or electron spin or some other stuff which people use, it gets a bit weird
2014-01-06 02:11:44	mjayk	so you could have one qbit for instance with 2048 possible states
2014-01-06 02:11:53	mjayk	and that one bit could crack 1024

2014-01-06 11:31:48	Damned	I was hoping you could have a little talk about heterogeneous system architecture and the ability of linux to take advantage of this,maybe even to leed. With the release this month of the AMD APU A10 7850K .Being the first APU to exceed 1 TFLOPS , the equivelent of a 7750 gpu on a 4ghtz quad cpu . This seems as if it could be the start of true hsa

2014-01-06 12:46:45	SnakeDoc	Heavensrevenge some of the greatest things have happened for Java and the JVM since Oracle got ahold of it... such as OpenJDK becoming upstream for all, integration of JavaFX, better JIT in the optimizing compiler (part of the JVM), aquisition of JRockit to bring massive performance improvements, etc.
2014-01-06 12:47:19	Heavensrevenge	they cant even update the core to solve a security problem, they just glaze over it and monkeypatch it vs fix the problem
2014-01-06 12:47:26	Heavensrevenge	its also how btrfs architecture is to me lol
2014-01-06 12:47:57	Heavensrevenge	heh and how oracle wanted to sue over dalvek
2014-01-06 12:48:07	Heavensrevenge	as an alternate java implementation
2014-01-06 12:48:51	Hayden	Since Davlik uses the JVM bytecode it is a ripoff.  (Whether it's legal is another thing...)
